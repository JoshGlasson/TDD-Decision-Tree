# TDD Decision Tree #

Build a decision tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) for the TDD Cycle.

It should accept a User Story as an input. It should output a Feature.

It should include the following levels:

Feature Test
Unit Test
Implementation
It should include Refactoring.

## Evidence Plan ##

I created the tree alongside another project where we were using TDD, so it mirrors the steps I took.
